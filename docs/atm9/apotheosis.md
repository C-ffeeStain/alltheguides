# Apotheosis

## Starting Setup (JEI REQUIRED)

### Requirements

Recipes for the shelves in this guide **WILL NOT BE PROVIDED**. Please use JEI. Other requirements include a brain and some sort of sensory organ to perceive this with.

### Seashelf Method

To start, make 17 of the `Seashelf` and place down all but 1 in a formation like the one below.

Once you've got those down, take your 17th `Seashelf`, place it in the enchanting table, and you should see an Infusion option for 3 EXP. It requires a certain level (mine was 46) to be selectable. Now replace one of the 16 placed `Seashelf` with your `Infused Seashelf`. Repeat this until all the original `Seashelf` have been replaced by their infused variant.  

After this, you'll need to break 9 of the `Infused Seashelf` and make 2 `Heart-Forged Seashelf` and 7 `Crystalline Seashelf`. Place these down where the original 9 were.  

Now, you will need to make 10 of the `Deepshelf`. With your current setup, you should be able to infuse each and every `Deepshelf`. Infuse all 10. Do not place any of them down just yet.  

After infusing all 10, make 5 of the `Soul-Touched Deepshelf` and 5 `Echoing Deepshelf`. Then, upgrade them to their `Sculkshelf` variant. Press U or right click on the respective shelf in JEI to see what the recipe is to upgrade them.  

It is now time to make some other shelves that don't require any infusion. You will need to make 3 `Shelf of End-Fused Rectification`. This might require some work.  

You will also need to make a `Draconic Endshelf`. To make the `Infused Dragon's Breath`, place down the 10 Sculkshelves made earlier and add 10 `Melonshelf`. A setup for this can be seen below; the placement of the shelves does not have to be exact.

After making the `Draconic Endshelf`, remove the 10 `Melonshelf`. Place the 3 `Shelf of End-Fused Rectification` and the `Draconic Endshelf` in a similar formation as shown in the `Seashelf` image above. This will get you the maximum level of enchanting. Your setup does not have to be in the exact same order as the one below; it is only an example.

## Spawner Changes

- **Remove AI**: {~~Chorus Fruit ~> Golden Apple ~~}
- **Ignore Players**: {~~Nether Star ~> Conduit ~~}
- **Increase Entities**: Ghast Tears | Max {~~ 32 ~> 16 ~~}
- **Increase Spawn Count**: {~~Fermented Spider's Eye ~> Piglich Heart~~} | Max {~~ 16 ~> 8 ~~}
- **Decrease Minimum Spawn Delay**: {~~ Sugar ~> AllTheModium Ingot ~~} | Min {~~ 20 ~> 100 ~~}
- **Decrease Maximum Spawn Delay**: {~~ Clock ~> Unobtainium Ingot ~~} | Min {~~ 20 ~> 100 ~~}

: The aim of these changes are to make removing **AI** easier, give **Conduits** more of a use, encourage people to look out for good spawners in the world, and bring spawners more in line with the other options available for farming mob drops, like **Hostile Neural Networks** or **Mystical Agriculture** or **Productive Bees** WannaBee mob farms.
